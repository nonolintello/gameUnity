Apple catcher : 
Basic apple catcher, without any of the bonuses we just added timer and a game over screen
Left and right arrows to control.
Easter egg implemented when you go far on the left with the basket you get a point every game tick... (this meaning there are no borders for the basket)


Brick Breaker : 
Basic brick breaker, tiles give 50 points, yellow tiles take 2 hits to break and also give 50 points, 10% chance to spawn a coin when breaking a tile, giving the player 100 points 
if he catches it.
Left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
At first, we wanted to add multiple power ups, other than just the bonus points dropping but we quickly abandoned that idea since it was basically just redoing the
original game.

Furapi bird : 
Up arrow key or space bar to make the bird jump. Added a little easter egg, for you to find (enter the konami code)

P.S : (if using an azerty keyboard then the konami code is (Up,Up,Down,Down,Left,Right,Left,Right,B,Q) whereas on qwerty it is (Up,Up,Down,Down,Left,Right,Left,Right,B,A)
